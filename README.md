# Graduation Project: Forked Spider Web
This project is a combination of **B2B e-commerce** and **inventory management systems**, designed to streamline operations for a manufacturing company that distributes its products across multiple warehouses.

## Project Overview

The system enables efficient order management, inventory tracking, and communication between clients and warehouse managers. It also incorporates **machine learning** for predictive analytics and inventory optimization.

## Features and Functionalities

### 1. Order Placement and Delivery
- Calculates the nearest warehouse to the client company using the **Haversine algorithm**, which leverages latitude and longitude for precise distance calculations.
- Ensures orders are delivered by the **nearest delivery company** for optimal efficiency.

---

### 2. Post-Delivery Feedback
- Allows client companies to **rate orders** upon delivery.
- Enables clients to initiate **sales returns** and provide reasons for the return.

---

### 3. Inventory Management
- **Product Transfers**: Seamlessly transfer products between warehouses as needed.
- **Stock Count**: Perform regular stock counts to ensure inventory accuracy.
- **Scrapping**: Manage scrapping of damaged or expired products.
- **Transaction Logs**: Maintain a comprehensive record of all transactions across warehouses.

---

### 4. Communication
- Provides a built-in chat system for direct communication between the client company and warehouse managers to address concerns efficiently.

---

### 5. Machine Learning Integration
- Predicts the **number of sales for each product** in a warehouse based on the **average daily demand**.
- Optimizes inventory distribution to avoid **shortages** or **overstocking**.

---

### 6. Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) and Reorder Point (ROP)
- Implements **EOQ** and **ROP** methods to optimize order quantities and minimize costs.
